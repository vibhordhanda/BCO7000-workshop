# RMarkdown editing


**R Markdown** Markdown is a lightweight markup language and created by John Gruber in 2004. Nowadays markdown is one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages. The file extension of a Markdown file is .md or .markdown. To compile a markdown file user needs an application capable of processing markdown files like Microsoft Word, Dillinger, etc. These applications utilize a Markdown parser which converts a markdown file to printable HTML code.
